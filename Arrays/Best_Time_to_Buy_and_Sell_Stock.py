You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Dry run:
Buy day 0, sell day 1: profit = -6 (not > 0, so max_profit stays 0)
Buy day 0, sell day 2: profit = -2(5-7) (not > 0, so max_profit stays 0)
Buy day 1, sell day 2: profit = 4 (4 > 0, so max_profit = 4)

example:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
